								<div class="inner" id="msg_42175">I believe that Dieter is a yellow-bellied coward, but that doesn&#039;t provide any evidence for his skiddlyness. There might be different coward powers for different coward alignments; he could hide behind a human so that views on him etc are redirected to that human, for example. I don&#039;t think he&#039;s revealed any details of his coward power either, beyond saying it&#039;s like nawa&#039;s. Has narwhal even said enough for Dieter to know that? His spy breadcrumb also doesn&#039;t prove anything; as we said before there&#039;s nothing that says a spy can&#039;t be chocolate.<br /><br />His sacrifice power is also a bit sketchy and I could imagine eep including a role where a wolf could sacrifice himself to mark someone (perhaps a &#039;sorcerer&#039;? I&#039;m not really clear on exactly what this term means.) or some other &#039;worth it&#039; thing. I doubt he&#039;d say he could kill himself if he couldn&#039;t arrange for that to happen, unless he had some really good excuse for it failing. Point is, we&#039;d never be able to trust his view unless some other evidence arose that proved him innocent. Besides, even if he&#039;s telling the truth, there&#039;s still a good chance he will just view Dr Agon and learn nothing.<br /><br />What he&#039;s claimed so far doesn&#039;t seem <em>too</em> OP, the Mason thing seems like it was the consequence of a Joiner or something, given it seems like they were all put in touch at the same time.<br /><br />Dr Agon says he knows who joined him to Dieter and Modi, Dieter doesn&#039;t seem to know and think&#039;s it was penut&#039;s failed attempt. It&#039;s also weird to me how Dieter seemed to assume he knew that penut was responsible, by saying that he could vouch for penut when his power failed, and is now having to sort of back off of that.<br /><br />Dr Agon, can you explain why you know and Dieter and Modi don&#039;t?<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://mysticboards.us/forums/index.php/topic,995.msg42153.html#msg42153">Quote from: Modi Thursday on January 28, 2013, 10:29:38 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">4 makes very little sense. I see no reason you would have assumed that you were a sorc, even if your family was chocolaty. This argument could also by anyone to say that if Dietcar is a human then me and Dr. Agon must be as well. <strong>This can&#039;t be true - someone in this family is an M&amp;M.</strong> If it was both me and Dietcar, then it would never have been intelligent to start this whole thing. Also, what does it mean for us to be talking about having chocolate children? Did we both have children? As far as I have seen, one person has a child and the rest are clueless about it. I am Dietcar&#039;s child and have no knowledge of children. Dietcar has only me, as far as I know.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Modi, there&#039;s nothing that says Dr Agon is in your family. Even Dieter could be lying to you somehow.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://mysticboards.us/forums/index.php/topic,995.msg42166.html#msg42166">Quote from: Modi Thursday on January 28, 2013, 12:47:21 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://mysticboards.us/forums/index.php/topic,995.msg42159.html#msg42159">Quote from: penut on January 28, 2013, 10:51:34 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">also do we know why dr.agon was put in contact with modi/dieter? i can&#039;t remember<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Note that regular powers such as seer are probably handled AT THE END OF THE NIGHT (though it&#039;s theoretically possible that it would be otherwise). Dr. Agon also mentioned in his PM to me and Dieter that he had no yet received information on Narwhal and was considering changing to Trient. Since we were thrown together in the middle of the night, this wouldn&#039;t make much sense.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I don&#039;t see how this is a response to penut&#039;s question, but it is a good point. Dr Agon suggested that he&#039;d gotten his view around the same time as he was meeting Dieter and Modi:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://mysticboards.us/forums/index.php/topic,995.msg42129.html#msg42129">Quote from: Dr. Agon on January 27, 2013, 11:38:17 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">4.&nbsp; it seemed natural to me at the time that I was a sorcerer and was unaware of it, especially since the two of them were talking about having chocolate children and my view of dietcar was that he was definately full of chocolate.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Narwhal knowing Dr Agon is a skittle is to me pretty damning evidence against the Dieter Modi side. Sure, it could be some weird sugar -&gt; chocolate transmogrificaiton, but that doesn&#039;t seem super likely. Unless Dr Agon, Narwhal and Trient are the wolves. What evidence do Narwhal and Trient have going for them at the moment?<br /><br />Also <strong>unvote</strong>. I agree about anime, he just doesn&#039;t feel like a good choice. I&#039;m heavily leaning Dieter, but I&#039;m waiting to see what else happens.<br /><br />Dr Agon, can you explain why Modi and Dietcar started right off talking about chocolate children in front of you?</div>
